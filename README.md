# ODA-Simulator

Welcome to the ODA Simulator! Based entirely on the excel sim run by Blackreign and (mostly) accurate to the crazy world of ODA.

Most new features and races are added and functional and accurate to Round 6.

Both files are working sims. The .xlsm file contains the macro for log generation. The .xlsx does not and should be better for non-windows users.

Updates:
* Raised max smithies to 20%
* Fixed an error where imps weren't updating properly

Current Issues:
* No unique unit costs: prestige, souls, essence, other units
* No new imps
* Non-functional Lux spell and training - In Progress
* No national bank exchange bonuses
* Unit pairing bonuses not yet added
* Snow Elves not yet implemented
* Networth values not accurate
