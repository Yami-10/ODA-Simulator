# ODA-Simulator

Welcome to the ODA Simulator! Based entirely on the excel sim run by Blackreign and (mostly) accurate to the crazy world of ODA.

Most new features and races are added and functional and accurate to Round 8.

Only the .xlsx file is currently available until I learn how to re-add macros back in.

Updates:
* Races updated to reflect most recent changes
* Snow Elf added
* Addition of Armory and Infirmary improvements (all thanks to Blackreign!)
* Hours changed to Ticks, time now in proper 15 minute increments (thanks again to BR!)
* Shaded cells pdated to represent new, 28-tick protection time (more BR praise!)

v8.2:
* Fixed mana cost of troops not being reduced from total mana
* Fixed merfolk unit pricing

Current Issues:
* No unique unit costs: prestige, souls, essence, other units
* Non-functional Lux spell and training - In Progress
* No national bank exchange bonuses
* Unit pairing bonuses not yet added
* Networth values not accurate
